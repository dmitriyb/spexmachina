# Installing spex

One binary is published on the [GitHub Releases page][releases]: `spex`
(linux/darwin, amd64/arm64). Every release archive is signed with SSHSIG
(`ssh-keygen -Y sign`), verifiable with the `ssh-keygen` that ships with
OpenSSH — no extra tool to install just to verify.

[releases]: https://github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/releases

## Why not `curl | sh`

A piped script executes as it streams and cannot verify itself before it
runs. Verification therefore has to wrap the download from outside the
stream: download the script, verify the script, then run it. That is the
whole reason the primary path is three commands rather than one pipe.

## Primary: verified install script

**bash / zsh:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/releases/latest/download/install.sh     -o install.sh \
&& curl -fsSL https://github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/releases/latest/download/install.sh.sig -o install.sh.sig \
&& ssh-keygen -Y verify -f <(printf 'dvbozhko@gmail.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIhmCWVDP/Tcm3CqXNjTQTChbKxr223xMob9zc56Uuny release signing\n') \
     -I dvbozhko@gmail.com -n file -s install.sh.sig < install.sh \
&& bash install.sh \
&& rm -f install.sh install.sh.sig
```

**fish:**

```fish
curl -fsSL https://github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/releases/latest/download/install.sh -o install.sh
and curl -fsSL https://github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/releases/latest/download/install.sh.sig -o install.sh.sig
and ssh-keygen -Y verify -f (printf 'dvbozhko@gmail.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIhmCWVDP/Tcm3CqXNjTQTChbKxr223xMob9zc56Uuny release signing\n' | psub) -I dvbozhko@gmail.com -n file -s install.sh.sig < install.sh
and bash install.sh
and rm -f install.sh install.sh.sig
```

**plain `sh`** (no `<(…)` process substitution): write the allowed-signers
line to a file first, then verify against it.

```sh
printf 'dvbozhko@gmail.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIhmCWVDP/Tcm3CqXNjTQTChbKxr223xMob9zc56Uuny release signing\n' > allowed_signers
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I dvbozhko@gmail.com -n file -s install.sh.sig < install.sh
```

The block verifies **the script itself** against the public key below and
only then runs it. `install.sh` resolves the latest release, detects your
OS/arch, downloads the matching `spex` archive and its signature, and
verifies the **binary** with the same key (embedded in the script, trusted
because the script was just verified) before installing it.

The script is bash, not POSIX `sh` — run it with `bash`. Set
`SPEX_INSTALL_VERSION=v0.1.0` before `bash install.sh` to install a specific
release, and pass `--dir DIR` to choose the install directory (default
`$HOME/.local/bin`).

## Maximal: verify the binary archive directly

No install script — download the archive for your platform from the
[Releases page][releases], then verify it by any one of:

```bash
# SSHSIG, against the same pinned key as above
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I dvbozhko@gmail.com -n file \
  -s spex_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz.sig < spex_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz

# SLSA provenance via Sigstore/Rekor — identity-anchored, no key to manage
gh attestation verify spex_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz --repo dmitriyb/spexmachina

# Go users: the Go module checksum database
go install github.com/dmitriyb/spexmachina/cmd/spex@<tag>
```

Archive names carry the version without its leading `v` —
`spex_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz` for tag `v0.1.0`. Each release also carries a
consolidated `spex_<version>_checksums.txt`, one `.sha256` per archive, and a
machine-readable `manifest.json` (schema, target, sha256, size per artifact).

## What each channel protects, and what it doesn't

- **Primary** verifies both the install script and the binary it fetches,
  end to end: `download → verify → run`, never a piped script.
- **Maximal** gives the strongest per-artifact check for a single file, with
  no script in between.
- The trust anchor in both cases is the public key **copied from this page**.
  That defeats tampering in transit; the residual risk is a look-alike copy
  of this repository, closed by using the known repository URL and by pinning
  the key **once** — copy it a single time, then verify every future release
  against that pinned copy.
- Signatures and attestations give **authenticity, not freshness**: an
  attacker who can intercept a download could still steer a *first install*
  to a genuine-but-older release. For *updates* this is closed: `spex upgrade`
  is forward-only and hard-refuses a resolved latest older than what is
  installed.

## Public key

```
dvbozhko@gmail.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIhmCWVDP/Tcm3CqXNjTQTChbKxr223xMob9zc56Uuny release signing
```

The same key serves all three verification paths above, and the same line
is published by spex's sibling tools, [faber](https://github.com/dmitriyb/faber)
and [portitor](https://github.com/dmitriyb/portitor), so one pinned copy
serves all three. It can be cross-checked against GitHub's own copy at
`https://api.github.com/users/dmitriyb/ssh_signing_keys` once it is added
under Settings → SSH and GPG keys → Signing keys — useful if this page itself
is suspected of being tampered with in a fork or mirror.

## Upgrading

An installed binary updates itself with `spex upgrade`, which embeds the same
signed `install.sh` and runs it against the running binary's own path: the
same resolve → download → SSHSIG-verify, then a safe in-place swap
(move-aside plus `rename(2)`, never a write over the running file), keeping
the previous binary as `<path>.bak`.

Upgrade is **forward-only**: it hard-refuses, non-overridably, a resolved
latest that is *older* than the installed version — a signature proves
authenticity, not freshness, so a latest that moved backward is treated as a
rollback anomaly. `--check` reports the comparison without changing anything,
`--version vX.Y.Z` installs an exact release in any direction (the deliberate
path to an older release), and `--rollback` restores the backup. See
[`commands.md`](commands.md) for the flag reference.
